# Solar System Project


## Description

This is an interactive 3D version of our solar system built in HTML, CSS, and Three.js. Explore the planets in any orientation you want, change their orbit speeds, halt their motion, or reverse them back to default speeds. Good for educational purposes and visualizing the operation of our solar neighborhood!

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have an internet connection (to load Three.js via CDN).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use the control panel to change planet speeds and click planets to view info.
4. Use your mouse to orbit and zoom the camera.

## Files

- `index.html` — Loads the scene.
- `app.js` — Contains all JavaScript logic.
- `styles.css` — Styles the UI and canvas.

## Demo Video

A separate `.mp4` or `.mov` file is attached.
