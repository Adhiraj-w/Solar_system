Solar_system

This is an interactive 3D version of our solar system built in HTML, CSS, and Three.js. Explore the planets in any orientation you want, change their orbit speeds, halt their motion, or reverse them back to default speeds. Good for educational purposes and visualizing the operation of our solar neighborhood!
